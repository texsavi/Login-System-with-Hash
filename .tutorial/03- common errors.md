## It's Not Logging Me In

ðŸ‘‰ What's the problem here?


```python
from replit import db

ans = input("Password >") 
salt = db["david"]["salt"]
newPassword = f"{ans}{salt}"
newPassword = hash(newPassword) 

if ans == db["david"]["password"]: 
  print("Login successful")
```

We were checking the *pre hashed* input in the 'ans' variable instead of the *post hashed* data in the 'newPassword' variable.

```python
from replit import db

ans = input("Password >") 
salt = db["david"]["salt"] 
newPassword = f"{ans}{salt}"
newPassword = hash(newPassword) 

if newPassword == db["david"]["password"]: #compare hash of newPassword to stored hash.
  print("Login successful")
```

## Hold The Salt

ðŸ‘‰ What is the problem here?
```python
from replit import db

ans = input("Password >") 
salt = db["david"]["salt"] 
newPassword = f"{salt}{ans}"
newPassword = hash(newPassword) 

if newPassword == db["david"]["password"]: 
  print("Login successful")
```

We've concatenated the salt at the beginning of the password in the fString. It should go on the end.

```python
from replit import db

ans = input("Password >") 
salt = db["david"]["salt"] 
newPassword = f"{ans}{salt}" # the salt should go on the end of the password
newPassword = hash(newPassword) 

if newPassword == db["david"]["password"]: 
  print("Login successful")
```
