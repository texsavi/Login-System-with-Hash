# It's Called Hashing

One of the big issues with storing usernames and passwords in a database is *what happens if we're hacked*?

If those passwords are stored as text, our users' security is compromised. Probably across multiple sites because they **ignored our advice and used the same password for everything!!!!!**


## Hashing

In reality, organizations *don't store your actual password*. They store a hash of your password. A hash is produced by turning your password into a sequence of numbers, then passing it though a hashing algorithm (some mathematical process that is very difficult to reverse engineer). The data spit out of this hashing algorithm is what's stored instead of your actual password.

ðŸ‘‰ So let's do it. I'm using the built-in `hash` function to create a numerical hash of the password. 

```python
password = "baldy1"
password = hash(password)
print(password)

# This will output a really long number

```
Play around with different strings on line 1 and notice how the hash number completely changes.

ðŸ‘‰ Now let's store that hashed version in our database instead of the actual password.

```python
from replit import db

userName = "david"
password = "baldy1"
password = hash(password)
db[userName] = password # Stores the hashed password in the database under the username key 'david'

print(password)
```

## Printing the Hash
ðŸ‘‰ Now I can output the value from the database using print. Notice how it outputs the hash.  That will be useless to a hacker. They cannot easily reverse engineer the password from the hash.

```python
from replit import db

print(db["david"])

```

To login a user, we get their password, input it, hash it, and compare it to the hash stored in the database because **a string will always produce the same hashed value**.

ðŸ‘‰ Let's build the login system that checks the stored hash against a hash of the input.

```python
from replit import db

ask = input("Password >") # Get the input
ask = hash(ask) # Hash the input

if ask == db["david"]: #compare hash of input to stored hash.
  print("Login successful")

```
